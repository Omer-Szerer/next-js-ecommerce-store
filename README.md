# Next.js E-commerce store

## About the project
This project is part of UpLeveled web development bootcamp. 
The task was to design and develop an ecommerce store using Next.js on our own, without using an all-in-one solution.
This isn't a real e-commerce store, and the page doesn't save or process any personal data.
